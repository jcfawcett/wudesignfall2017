		<h1>"It's The End Of The World As We Know It (And I Feel Fine)"</h1>
		<h2>By R.E.M.</h2>


		That's great, it starts with an earthquake<br>
		Birds and snakes, an aeroplane, and Lenny Bruce is not afraid<br>
		<br>

		<p>Eye of a hurricane, listen to yourself churn<br>
		World serves its own needs, don't misserve your own needs<br>
		Feed it up a knock, speed, grunt, no, strength<br>
		The ladder starts to clatter with a fear of height, down, height<br>
		Wire in a fire, represent the seven games<br>
		And a government for hire and a combat site<br>
		Left her, wasn't coming in a hurry with the Furies breathing down your neck</p>

		<p>Team by team, reporters baffled, trumped, tethered, cropped
		Look at that low plane, fine, then
		Uh-oh, overflow, population, common group
		But it'll do, save yourself, serve yourself
		World serves its own needs, listen to your heart bleed
		Tell me with the Rapture and the reverent in the right, right
		You vitriolic, patriotic, slam fight, bright light
		Feeling pretty psyched</p>

		It's the end of the world as we know it
		It's the end of the world as we know it
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine

		Six o'clock, TV hour, don't get caught in foreign tower
		Slash and burn, return, listen to yourself churn
		Lock him in uniform, book burning, bloodletting
		Every motive escalate, automotive incinerate
		Light a candle, light a motive, step down, step down
		Watch your heel crush, crush, uh-oh
		This means no fear, cavalier, renegade and steering clear
		A tournament, a tournament, a tournament of lies
		Offer me solutions, offer me alternatives, and I decline

		It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it (I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
		I feel fine (I feel fine)

		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

		The other night I dreamt a nice continental drift divide
		Mountains sit in a line, Leonard Bernstein
		Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs
		Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom
		You symbiotic, patriotic, slam but neck, right? Right

		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

		It's the end of the world as we know it
		It's the end of the world as we know it
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)

		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it (It's time I had some time alone)
		It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine (It's time I had some time alone)
